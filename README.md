# strcomp
Compare two strings and pretty-print the result

## Why use strcomp?
`strcmp` is a perfectly fine tool.

But it doesn't pretty print.

Use `strcomp` if you'd like to *see* where in the string a mismatch occurs.

## Usage
1. Download the file named `strcomp` from this project.
2. Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your path variable.
3. Move `strcomp` to your `/usr/local/bin` directory.
4. Enjoy :-)
